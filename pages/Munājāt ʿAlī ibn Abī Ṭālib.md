## Munājāts attribtued to ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib

### Textuality
Munājāts attributed to ʿAlī circulated independently of his sermons, sayings, and letters collected in _Nahj al-balāgha_. 
Individual supplications have nonetheless enjoyed sustained exegetical attention.[^1] In terms of their textuality, whether _Biḥār al-anwār_ includes any munājāt attributed to ʿAlī still needs fact-checking, but the modern Iranian scholar Muḥammad Bāqir Maḥmūdī who compiled _Nahj al-saʻādah fī mustadrak nahj al-balāghah_ did not cite _Biḥār al-anwār_ as a source for his fourth volume on selected supplications attributed to ʿAlī.  

In this volume, four munājāts of varying lengths and interspersed between other prayers attributed to ʿAlī are not treated as a unity. The only verse munājāt among the four, anthologized in the most widely used contemporary Shīʿīte prayer manuals _Mafātīḥ al-jinān_, is not introduced with a chain of transmission and it is unclear when this verse munājāt was first canonized. The current collection includes five related texts: a 15th century [takhmīs](https://layilin.github.io/munajat/item.html?id=mnj002) based on it, a 16th century [copy](https://layilin.github.io/munajat/item.html?id=mnj016) comissioned for the private use of the Ottoman şeyhülislâm Hoca Sadettin Efendi (d.1599), an 18th century [copy](https://layilin.github.io/munajat/item.html?id=mnj008) and a 19th century [copy](https://layilin.github.io/munajat/item.html?id=mnj010) with interlinear translations for Persian speakers, and an undated [album of calligraphy](https://layilin.github.io/munajat/item.html?id=mnj009) that takes its individual bayts for artistic representation.

For detailed comparisons between the three versions, see [this document](https://github.com/layilin/munajat/blob/main/docs/collation_prose_%E2%80%98Ali.pdf).
