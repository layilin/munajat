## Munājāts attribtued to ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib

### Textuality
Munājāts attributed to ʿAlī circulated independently of the body of his sermons, sayings, and letters collected in Nahj al-balāgha. 
Individual supplications have nonetheless enjoyed sustained exegetical attention.[^1]  The textuality of munājāts attributed to ‘Ali, however, proves highly problematic. Whether Biḥār al-anwār includes any munājāt attributed to ‘Ali along with those attributed to ‘Ali Zayn al-‘Ābidīn still needs some fact-checking, but the modern Iranian scholar Muḥammad Bāqir Maḥmūdī who compiled Nahj al-saʻādah fī mustadrak nahj al-balāghah did not cite Biḥār al-anwār as a source for his fourth volume on selected supplications attributed to the Commander of the Faithful.  In this volume, four munājāts, of varying lengths and interspersed between other prayers attributed to ‘Ali, are not treated as a unity. The only verse munājāt among the four, anthologized in the most widely used contemporary Shiʻite prayer manuals Mafātīḥ al-jinān, is not introduced with a chain of transmission. 
For detailed comparisons between the three versions, see [this document](https://github.com/layilin/munajat/blob/main/docs/collation_prose_%E2%80%98Ali.pdf).
